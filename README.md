# my first responsive website test project
 ## my first responsive website made on the DevMedia platform

 Example site, made to promote a medical clinic.
 this site was not published on the web, but you can download the files, codes and images<br>
  if you want here, through github.

I modified some things in the project, to learn and give it a personal touch, such as colors, fonts and even some ways of how the site responds.

### Demonstration of how the site turned out, and the responsiveness:
